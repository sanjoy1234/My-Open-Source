Projects that I have developed

1. A Web Crawler having the ability to crawl complete web sites, fixing rulebased broken links, can also run through links part of java script alerts.

2. A Web Content Monitor which connects to web site and monitor the content chnages for specific pages to be watched. This is an
   extremely cool tool in terms of keeping a watch on the content those are frequently changing in the web sites and for 
   such cases many of the projects are having billion of loss.
